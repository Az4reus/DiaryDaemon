#DiaryDaemon

Are you like me? Do you like the idea of a diary, but are consistently too lazy to 
find a notebook and write down your thoughts? Well, fear no more! DiaryDaemon is here
to save your laziness conflict with a very simple solution. Follow these simple steps 
towards a life of remembering what you had for breakfast yesterday!

* Clone this repository!
* Compile this repository! (Binaries will come soon TM)
* Put a shortcut to the .exe into your startup folder! (run `shell:startup` in your Win+R dialogue.)
* Configurate `DiaryDaemon.exe.config` with your own personal filepath! 
* Run DiaryDaemon!
* Hit Alt and Numpad0 at the same time!
* Write your captivating thoughts into the pop-up!
* Hit Enter! 
* Rest assured that your thoughts will be categorised and appropriately sorted and preserve until the end of time!

Your entries end up in the folder you designated, neatly sorted into months, and then days.
All entries are timestamped, and are simple plaintext. 

It's That Simple(TM, patent pending)

## Things To Do At Some Point In The Future
- [ ] A not hardcoded hotkey for the popup.
- [ ] Write Tests.
- [ ] Write a less terrible Readme.
